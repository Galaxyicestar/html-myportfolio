          <h3>Computer coding</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code when I was 9 i've been coding for roughly 3 years . If I were to rank my coding ability on a scale of 1-10, I would
          say for css: 9/10, HTML:8/10 and Javascript: 6/10.   </p>

          <h3> Novel writing</h3>
          <p>Ever since reading my first mythology book by  <a href="#">Rick-Riordan; The lighting theif</a> and many more of his books
          I was determined to write books just like his. After some experiment I figured out I was no good at mythologyüôÑ; every time
        I would try to start a mythology novel, I would find my self writing the same plot he had. So I went exploring more books and <br>
      and found some authors with books I loved almost as much as <a href="#">Rick-Riordan's</a> books. Which lead me to learn, I love
    <em>Dystopyian fiction and mystery novels alot</em>. Now I have succesfully written my first novel <em>The penelope doll.</em> and i'm working
  on my most recent work 'the model of pretty'  </p>
